# Mark W. Hendrickson for Santa Clara City Council - Landing Page

This repository contains the source code for the official landing page for Mark W. Hendrickson's campaign for Santa Clara City Council.

## Project Overview

The website is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript. It is designed to be professional, trustworthy, mobile-responsive, and fast-loading.

### Key Features:

*   **Single File Deployment:** All code (HTML, CSS, JS) is in `index.html` for easy deployment.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   **WCAG Compliant:** Built with accessibility best practices in mind.
*   **Performance Optimized:** Clean code and minimal dependencies for fast load times.

## How to Deploy to Netlify

This site is ready for immediate deployment on Netlify. You can deploy it in just a few clicks.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1.  **Sign up for a Netlify account:** If you don't have one, go to [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) and sign up for a free account.

2.  **Drag and Drop Deployment:**
    *   Log in to your Netlify account.
    *   Go to the "Sites" tab.
    *   Simply drag the `mark4sc.com` folder (the one containing `index.html`) from your computer and drop it into the deployment area on the Netlify dashboard.

3.  **That's it!** Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site, assigning it a random URL (e.g., `random-name-12345.netlify.app`).

### (Optional) Setting a Custom Domain:

Once deployed, you can easily add a custom domain:

1.  Go to your site's settings in Netlify.
2.  Find the "Domain management" section.
3.  Click "Add custom domain" and follow the instructions to link your domain (e.g., `mark4sc.com`) to the Netlify site.

## Local Development

To view the site locally, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
